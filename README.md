# Receipt scanning

A machine learning approach for scanning and extracting the information from swedish receipts. This solution is based on three different machine learning approaches. The first one uses a two-layered BiLSTM for character-wize classification. The second is based on a graph convolutional network and the third uses a pretrained model called BERT.
